# This is just to plan the study of AspnetCore

## Fundamentals

- Advantage of Aspnet core.
- Razor Pages vs MVC vs API vs Minimal API when and where to use?
- Dependency injection
- Host
- Middleware / request pipeline
- Configuration, Options
- Logging
- Routing
- Error handling
- Static files and how it is served.

### MVC

- Razor syntax.
- Model binding
- validation, error handlings

## State management

- Cookies
  - Session
  - Tempdata
  - Querysting
  - HiddenField
  - HttpContext.item
  - Cache.
    - In memory caching
      - distributed caching
      - Response caching
      - Object pool.
        - Get/Return

## Security

- Localization/globalization
- Error handling
- Hosting

## Swagger / Open api

- What is both of these.
- Basic configuration
- Customizations

## An interview questions

1. WAP to un-format a string (opposite of String.Format)
2. WAP to find the most repeating character from a string. In case of ties, get the one with max ASCII value
3. Write a full REST API with data calls, paging for big data set
4. Write a sample business class and test with mocks
5. Paging in SQL Server
6. How the whole authentication & authorization flow works
7. Benefits & challenges of converting your current application to Microservices

1. Remove a given node from a LL, when no _head is given
2. From a long array of numbers, print all pairs that sum up to a given value k
3. From a long array of numbers (from -int.MinValue to int.MaxValue), find the maximum sum sub-array, i.e. the maximum sum possible from any contiguous sub-array
4. Find age of three sisters, with hints given
  a. D1 *D2* D3 = 72
  b. D1 + D2 + D3 = house#
  c. "The eldest daughter loves ice-cream"

1. Design class/model design for a Chinese Checkers board game
2. Design a highly scalable caching system, with following basic requirements
  a. Distributed system behind a dumb load-balancer
  b. Highly scalable - add boxes to scale-up automatically
  c. Maximum performance possible, with almost no downtime, no wait/delay
  d. Minimize points of failure
3. OData
4. JWT
5. SSL and channel creation, full security
6. Mutex & Semaphore
7. Isolation levels in SQL Server
